      <h2>The YOLO Development Manifesto</h2>

      <p>We are uncovering better ways of shipping software by doing it and helping others YOLO it. Through this experience, we have come to value:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shipping over thinking - Why test when you can rest?</li>
        <li>Production hotfixes over documentation - Documentation is just spoilers for your code</li>
        <li>Copy-pasting over understanding - If it worked for someone on StackOverflow, it'll work for us</li>
        <li>Responding to crashes over following a plan - The users are our QA team</li>
        <li>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value living dangerously on the left more.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Our Principles:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy ourselves through the early and continuous deployment of untested code.</li>
        <li>Welcome changing requirements, even at 4:59 PM on a Friday. YOLO processes harness chaos for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
        <li>Deploy to production frequently, from a couple of times per day to a couple of times per minute.</li>
        <li>"#TODO: Add comments later" is a perfectly acceptable documentation strategy.</li>
        <li>The best architectures emerge from 3 AM coding sessions fueled by energy drinks.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> "It works on my machine" is not just a statement, it's a way of life.</p>
