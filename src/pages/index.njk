      <h2>The YOLO Development Manifesto</h2>

      <p>We are uncovering better ways of shipping software by doing it and helping others YOLO it. Through this experience, we have come to value:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shipping over thinking - Why test when you can rest?</li>
        <li>Production hotfixes over documentation - Documentation is just spoilers for your code</li>
        <li>Copy-pasting over understanding - If it worked for someone on StackOverflow, it'll work for us</li>
        <li>Responding to crashes over following a plan - The users are our QA team</li>
        <li>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value living dangerously on the left more.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Our Principles:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy ourselves through the early and continuous deployment of untested code.</li>
        <li>Welcome changing requirements, even at 4:59 PM on a Friday. YOLO processes harness chaos for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
        <li>Deploy to production frequently, from a couple of times per day to a couple of times per minute.</li>
        <li>"#TODO: Add comments later" is a perfectly acceptable documentation strategy.</li>
        <li>The best architectures emerge from 3 AM coding sessions fueled by energy drinks.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> "It works on my machine" is not just a statement, it's a way of life.</p>

        Built around a CSS workflow that emphasizes guiding browser styling rather than micromanaging it. It
        incorporates progressive enhancement, fluid type and spacing, and utilizes modern CSS features for
        layout. The goal is to develop frontends that provide a great experience across all devices,
        connection speeds, and usage contexts.

        <strong>This is version 4.</strong> I keep a
        <a href="https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/tree/v1">branch of v1</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/tree/v2">v2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/tree/v3">v3</a>. I  tried to <a href="/get-started/#docs-lol">document most features and methodologies</a>.

      <p><strong>Have fun</strong> and let me know if you find any issues or have ideas for improvements!</p>
